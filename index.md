<h3> 👨‍💻 ManTech Scanner Application </h3>
I Created an Application that interfaces with existing ManTech technology, and enables employees to scan in equipment and track the location and scan date of every existing equipment.

I designed an AI to learn how to play the popular game Tic Tac Toe without any humans teaching it using Q-Learning.
